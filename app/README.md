# [Member Directory App](https://webdevatlanta.github.io/MemberDirectory)

This the front-end component of the Web Dev Atlanta Member Directory App. It is a React application and uses Material Design UI elements. The app runs completely within Github Pages, without any other server dependency. Membership data is stored in a repository, which is queried by the app when loaded by the browser.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Admin Mode
The app has a basic Admin mode, which provides some editing capabilities for admins. See the 'admin' section for more information about this feature.

## Game Mode
Practice your recall of member names.
