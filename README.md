# [Member Directory App](https://webdevatlanta.github.io/MemberDirectory)

This is an online directory for the Web Dev Atlanta Meetup group.

Check it out: https://webdevatlanta.github.io/MemberDirectory

## Add your profile
1. [Create a new public gist](https://gist.github.com/)
2. Fill out the three required fields:
    - Set '_Gist description..._' to `WebDevAtlanta Profile`
    - Set '_Filename including extension..._' to `webdevatlanta-profile`
    - Set the Gist content to some text about yourself, your status, your stack, your favorite movie... anything you want.
3. Save as a new Public Gist, and post the resulting url to the WebDevATL [Slack channel](https://webdevatlanta.slack.com).
4. An admin will add you to the directory. Welcome!

## Remove your profile
Should you decide you don't want to be listed anymore, simply delete your Gist.

## Customize your profile
By default, your Github avatar image is used for your profile. If you prefer a different image, you should use JSON in profile instead of plaintext. Here is an example:

```
{
  "avatar": "https://image.example.com/your-profile-image.png",
  "status": "This is where you put your profile text."
}
```
